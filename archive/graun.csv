They are the way we make sense of the world, our lives and relationships. They may not always be true, completely, or even substantially. They may be tinged with hyperbole and hope, fiercely contested or modified by hand-me-down retelling. Key characters and memories are conveniently or painfully lost in the miasma of pride, shame and trauma. But the best stories retain a flicker of emotional truth, a resonance that outlives the events, people and places they describe. The questions they raise are, as the philosopher Richard Rorty observed, “part of the process of deciding what we will do next, what we will try to become”. Some provide the key to atonement, others a safe or challenging place to consider the lessons of the past. Others, over time, make the journey to myth, where they console and distract from more confronting truths.This applies to nations as well as individuals, families and communities. Stories “underlie the necessary fiction that is ‘us’”, the Irish commentator Fintan O’Toole wrote as he pondered what is the Irish story. The challenge is to allow multiple stories. Identity is not an either/or. It is possible to be attached to different places, beliefs and ways of being at the same time. To share an inner life with others of a complex place where belonging, not exclusion, prevails."

In short, everythingClimate breakdown is accelerating rapidly, many of the impacts will be more severe than predicted and there is only a narrow chance left of avoiding its worst ravages, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said.Even at current levels, human actions in heating the climate are causing dangerous and widespread disruption, threatening devastation to swathes of the natural world and rendering many areas unliveable, according to the landmark report published on Monday.Everywhere is affected, with no inhabited region escaping dire impacts from rising temperatures and increasingly extreme weather.About half the global population – between 3.3 billion and 3.6 billion people – live in areas “highly vulnerable” to climate change.Millions of people face food and water shortages owing to climate change, even at current levels of heating.Mass die-offs of species, from trees to corals, are already under way.1.5C above pre-industrial levels constitutes a “critical level” beyond which the impacts of the climate crisis accelerate strongly and some become irreversible.Coastal areas around the globe, and small, low-lying islands, face inundation at temperature rises of more than 1.5C.Key ecosystems are losing their ability to absorb carbon dioxide, turning them from carbon sinks to carbon sources.Some countries have agreed to conserve 30% of the Earth’s land, but conserving half may be necessary to restore the ability of natural ecosystems to cope with the damage wreaked on them."

The answer, according to the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, is that the odds of annihilation are lower than previously imagined. Scientists are clear that not enough is being done to head off a climate disaster. The IPCC suggests about 40% of the human race is living in the danger zone, and that many ecosystems are being irretrievably degraded. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, was forthright in describing the abdication of leadership by world powers as “criminal”. The world’s biggest polluters, he said, “are guilty of arson on our only home”.No amount of global heating is safe. If the world’s average temperatures rise by 1.5C – the goal of the Paris climate agreement – the IPCC report warns that up to 14% of species on land face a very high risk of extinction. At 3C, not an outlandish rise, almost a third of life on terra firma could be gone. This report is a final warning. The next time the world’s scientists pronounce will be at the end of the decade – when it will be too late to stop the rot. That is why it remains essential to stick to the UN targets of cutting global greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 and achieving global net zero emissions by 2050. And why it is hugely disappointing that current commitments will see emissions increase by 14%. This risks a world in social chaos."

So make a change now, and make it one you can stick toIf the prospect of nuclear war wasn’t enough, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) picked this week to drop its latest report on the state of the climate crisis.The key findings are bleak, if familiar. Climate breakdown is accelerating rapidly; many of the impacts will be more severe than predicted. Nowhere will be spared. “The scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet,” said Hans-Otto Pörtner, a co-chair of the working group producing this report. These health impacts are physical – ​​increased chance of dengue fever, for example, or cardiovascular disease – but also mental: the suffering of living through storms, famine, heat stress, and the loss of homes and cultures.Alice Bell is co-director at the climate change charity Possible and author of Our Biggest Experiment: A History of the Climate Crisis"

This has led to subsidised wood burning for electricity generation and is part of the appeal of an evening around a roaring fire. This idea relies on the carbon released from wood burning being reabsorbed by forests and woodland. Reality is more complex.Firstly, it takes time for new forests to regrow and absorb the carbon. For large-scale wood burning for power generation using wood imported from North America, it can take decades or perhaps more than a century for forests to reabsorb this additional carbon from our air. This means greater chances of irreversible climate tipping points before any possible benefits accrue."

The rush to disinvest from Russia is impressively quick since it’s possible to imagine an alternative script in which the oil companies’ boards tried to buy time by issuing woolly “all options are open” statements. A definitive statement to sell its 20% stake in Rosneft (in BP’s case) and ditch all partnerships with Gazprom (Shell’s position) leaves no ambiguity. There can be no going back.The mechanics of the exit are yet to be determined, and BP’s route to disentanglement is probably simpler. The company has had a wild ride in Russia over the years (one minute it was fighting local oligarchs, the next it was in partnership with them), but since 2013 it has been reduced to the role of dividend-collecting passive investor in Rosneft."

The reconstruction job from Covid-19 had barely begun when Russia invaded Ukraine. Now the international consensus to build back better from the pandemic has been replaced by an urgent need to prevent the conflict from escalating.With such high stakes, economic sanctions, not bombs, are the western weapon of choice, limiting Vladimir Putin’s ability to muster guns and butter. But while there will be harsher consequences for Russia, made a pariah under the Putin regime, it is a battle not without economic collateral damage. European leaders will this week announce a strategy to cut Europe’s reliance on Russian energy – a plan in the works before the first tank rolled into Ukraine, now given added urgency. With Russia accounting for 40% of EU gas imports – rising to 65% in Germany and 100% for some eastern European states – it is a prudent move. Yet it is a process likely to take years. In the meantime, the shock of war will drive up energy prices across the continent – adding to what was already the worst squeeze on living standards in decades."

The first is that without a transplant, I will die, and I will die soon.

The ongoing refusal to abandon visa restrictions for Ukrainians, as one of the gravest refugee crises since the second world war unfolds on European soil, cannot stand.

But is this world-class arts centre now in danger of being turned into a shopping mall?It looks like something from a wildly imaginative sci-fi comic, an impossible vision of worlds slamming into each other in a fantastical collage. Elevated walkways leap across the sky while a trio of towers rise up like serrated blades, their edges sawing at the clouds. Beneath them, fountains cascade and cafes spill across lush waterside terraces, while an art gallery and library jut out overhead. A tropical conservatory wraps around the top of a subterranean theatre, next to a cinema buried beneath a crescent of apartments. And the entire multilayered edifice floats above a 2,000-seat concert hall carved into the ground.This is no sci-fi comic, but a cutaway diagram of the Barbican arts centre dating from 1982, rendered in vivid orange, red and green. Somehow, this miraculous Escher-like wonder really did get built, and it hits 40 this month, with celebratory events and a handsome new book modestly titled Building Utopia."

He will keep rabbits, sheep, cows, dogs, cats, horses and pigeons. There will be a guesthouse that he can rent out to tourists. He doesn’t mind where the farm is – in the UK or back home in Pakistan – as long as there is room for his animals. “I love all the animals,” he says. “Farming is a dream life. I would love it.”For now, Khan (not his real name) works in London as a courier for a delivery app. Khan, who is in his early 30s, didn’t expect to end up couriering. His plan was always to set up a business. He is a natural entrepreneur. When he was at school in Pakistan, he bought sandwiches and sold them for profit at a market. When he was studying business management, he sold sim cards at a train station. He was good at it – and it is not hard to see why.

Adding “the” to Batman’s name has become a huge part of the brand identity, a sign of how elemental and atavistic this shadowy figure is supposed to be. You can imagine some growly voice saying “the Batman” – but not Tom Holland putting on a deep baritone to say he’s “the Spider-Man”, or Henry Cavill booming he’s “the Superman” (although maybe you could have Billy Joel stride into a dark Gotham City bar to raspingly confront “the Piano Man”).Director and co-writer Matt Reeves has created a new Batman iteration in which Robert Pattinson reinvents billionaire Bruce Wayne as an elegantly wasted rock star recluse, willowy and dandyish in his black suit with tendrils of dark hair falling over his face; but Wayne magically trebles in bulk when he reappears in costume and mask as the Dark Knight, his whole being weaponised into a slab-like impassivity. And this of course is happening in the sepulchral vastness of Gotham City, the brutal and murky world which Christopher Nolan thrillingly pioneered with his Dark Knight trilogy and made indispensable for imagining Batman on screen."

One-nil, to the Arsenal.” It is perhaps unthinkable to those reared on Arsène Wenger’s Invincibles but, during the early ’90s, this was the defining ethos of the Gunners; belted out by supporters as George Graham’s side attempted to bore opponents to death before, up the other end, Ian Wright could pop up to provide a winner. These days, nobody is going to be confusing Jamie Young for David Seaman or or Léo Lacroix for Tony Adams, and we can only hope John Aloisi’s tenure in Melbourne’s west does not end in a similar fashion to Graham’s in north London. However, almost 30 years on from that chant ringing out over Highbury, A-League Men leaders Western United are performing their own little tribute to that side: riding a wave of one-goal victories to the top of the table and, potentially, league glory."

Out of Australia’s men’s Test team for more than two years, the 35-year-old Pakistan-born batter forced his way back into the starting XI with twin centuries in this year’s Sydney Ashes Test. It was a match he was only playing in because Travis Head, ahead of him for the No 5 batting spot, had tested positive for Covid.Now, Khawaja is on his way back to the country of his birth as part of the first Australia tour to Pakistan in 24 years. “I’m not that much of a narcissist that I believe that there’s an agenda with fate,” says Khawaja, shortly before Australia’s departure. “There’s nothing saying that all this happened just so that I could go back to Pakistan.

Well-funded paramilitaries within Ukraine’s borders will be encouraged to create as much disorder as possible. There will be a blitz of propaganda, misinformation and false-flag operations. And then – finally – the blood sacrifice: the trained young men and women prepared to lay down their bodies for greater Russia.Perhaps we all got a taste of how this might play out on a much smaller scale on Thursday night. As a distraught Kamila Valieva left the ice after a disastrous skate that would cost her a medal in the Olympic women’s competition, the first person to greet her was her coach, Eteri Tutberidze. “Why did you let it go?” she screeched at Valieva in disbelief. “Explain it to me.

We know about the blood, sweat and tears, but the costs paid by the 15-year-old figure skater Kamila Valieva in pursuit of the glittering prize rose exorbitantly over the past week in Beijing. The already unstable Olympic currency of values, integrity and humanity devalued further. There was almost universal horror watching Valieva’s coach, Eteri Tutberidze, in action. Her harsh questions as Valieva sought to escape the rink after her unravelling performance caused consternation. Even the fence-sitting International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, spoke out. But after the initial repudiation and disgust, her approach struck a troublesome chord.

David Warner, with an Ashes average in Australia of 60, would not make a hundred and would average 34. Marnus Labuschagne, on a streak of 13 Tests averaging 73, would make one small and lucky hundred and average 42. Fast-bowling leader Josh Hazlewood would miss four Tests, Pat Cummins would miss one, and Australia would call on three replacement quicks with two Tests between them.The thing about witches in a forest glade, as Macbeth could attest, is that beneath the promises lies a catch. Not that England took many of those, but still. Despite all of the above going the touring team’s way, they experienced a series thrashing with few statistical peers. Those top-line players were the focus of supposed years of planning, yet it was Australia’s second rank that dominated whenever called upon."

Perhaps a reminder of some of the best moments of the past fortnight will help ease the painIt was the most anticipated moment of the Tokyo 2020 swim meet: American swim queen Katie Ledecky against 20-year-old Australian Ariarne Titmus in the 400m freestyle. Ledecky had dominated the event for years, but had been upstaged by a teenaged Titmus at the 2019 world championships. After two years without competition, the rivals were back in the pool. The 400m discipline is gruelling – too long for all-out sprinting, too short for an endurance rhythm. Ledecky led out and was ahead of Titmus for most of the race, before the Tasmanian surged in the final lap to win her first Olympic gold medal. It was a tactical swim executed to perfection. And it got the celebration it deserved from Titmus’s coach, Dean Boxall, who caught the world’s attention with his gyrations. (Kieran Pender)"

The first is the number of gold medals: 17 – equal with the nation’s best previous haul at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. The second is the differential between the number of golds and silvers: 17 first-place performances and seven second places. Among the top 10 countries on the Tokyo medal tally, it is the best gold-to-silver ratio.“One of the big issues that was identified in Rio was performing under pressure – converting opportunities to medals,” says Peter Conde, director of the Australian Institute of Sport, a government agency tasked with funding and guiding high-performance sport in Australia. “I think you’d have to say that our athletes and our teams have really performed under pressure at these Games.”"

For most of its customers, the answer today would probably be much the same as it was when Winston Churchill helped to set up the UK’s pool-betting operation nearly a century ago. The Tote is there for recreational, relatively small-scale punters, and racegoers in particular, who want a fiver each-way for an interest, or a few quid in the Placepot in the hope of a decent return at the end of the afternoon.And while hardly anyone on a day out at the races is bothered about the mechanics of Tote betting, one key point is generally understood: there’s no bookie.
